# ArtisConnect Project Proposal

## Project Overview

ArtisConnect is a digital marketplace aimed at empowering Ugandan artisans by connecting them with local buyers through a modern e-commerce platform. This platform enables artisans to showcase and sell their handmade goods such as crafts, jewelry, fashion, and home décor, bridging the gap between traditional craftsmanship and the growing digital economy. The platform provides tools to simplify the complexities of payments, logistics, and customer service, allowing artisans to focus on growing their businesses.

### Understanding Ugandan Artisans

Ugandan artisans are skilled individuals who create handmade products using traditional techniques and craftsmanship. These artisans often work with locally sourced materials to produce a wide variety of goods, including:

- **Crafts**: Baskets, pottery, sculptures, and other decorative items made from natural materials like wood, clay, and fibers.
- **Jewelry**: Handcrafted necklaces, bracelets, earrings, and rings using beads, metals, and stones.
- **Fashion**: Unique clothing, footwear, and accessories, often incorporating African prints and designs.
- **Home Décor**: Items like furniture, wall hangings, and fabrics, designed to add an artistic and cultural touch to living spaces.

These artisans contribute to preserving Uganda’s cultural heritage while playing an essential role in the local economy. Despite their skills, many artisans face challenges in accessing wider markets due to the lack of digital infrastructure. ArtisConnect seeks to bridge this gap by providing them with an accessible platform to grow their businesses and reach new customers.
